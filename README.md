# Homebridge Casambi Plugin

Adds support for devices controlled using the Casambi App. Requires an API Key to access the Cloud API. To acquire the key, contact the [Casambi Support](mailto:support@casambi.com).

The network must have an administrator password and there must be a gateway device (a phone running the Casambi App) within the vicinity of the lights, at all times. The Cloud API servers use its Bluetooth radio to communicate with the lights.

In this early version, only _lights_ are supported with the ability to turn them on/off, dim and change the color temperature.
